### Both ends are fixed:

$$
n \frac{\lambda}{2} = l
$$
$$
\frac{n}{2} \frac{v}{f} = l
$$
$$
f = n \frac{v}{2l}
$$
where f-frequency of standing wave
n- mode/harmonic number
f_1 - fundamental frequency

first frequency - fundamental mode
(n-1)th frequency - nth overtone

### Both sides are open:

When the string has one of its ends fixed and the other end is free, the node will be formed at the fixed end, and the antinode will be formed at the free end. The simplest standing wave formed in this condition is one-quarter a wavelength long. The next possible standing wave will be formed by adding both node and antinode. The length of this wave will be three-quarters of the wavelength. In general, the wavelength of the wave can be written as

λ = 4L/n , here n = 1,2,3…..

Then, the frequency of the standing wave is restricted to

f = nv/4L

+ All hormonics are open
+ Only odd hormnoics are present
