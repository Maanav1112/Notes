# Velocity in SHM
Velocity and displacement curve
	![[Graphical-representation-of-SHM-3.png]]
	*The graph between velocity and displacement is an ellipse*

$$x = A \sin(\omega t + \phi)$$
$$v = \frac{dx}{dt} = A \frac{d}{dt}\sin (\omega t + \phi ) $$
$$v = A \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi)$$
Speed is maximum at mean and minimum at extremes

# Acceleration in SHM
![[Graphical-representation-of-SHM-2.png]]
$$v = A \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi)$$
Acceleration is, 
$$a = \frac{dv}{dt} = A \omega \frac{d}{dt} \cos (\omega t + \phi)$$
$$a = -A \omega^2 \sin(\omega t + \phi)$$
$$a = - \omega^2 x $$

# Combination of Springs

## Springs in series
![[Springs-in-Series-Combination.png]]

$$k_{s} = \frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{1}+ k_{2}}$$

## Springs in parallel


![Parallel Combination of Springs](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parallel-Combination-of-Springs.png "Parallel Combination of Springs")$$k_{p} = k_{1} + k_{2}$$
## Spring is cout
When spring is cut, spring constant is inversely proprotional to length

# Force law for SHM
F = - kx 
a = F/M = -k/m x 
$$a = - \omega^2 x$$
$$\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}$$
$$\omega^2 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$
T = 2 pi root m/k
