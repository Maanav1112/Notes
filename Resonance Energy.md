#Chemistry 
- The amount of energy used during delocalisation
- Energy difference between resonance hybrid and most stable canonical form
RE = RH - MSCH = -ve
tells us how much RH is stable as that of MSCF

> Stability $\propto$ RE $\propto$ Number of conjugating sites


More benzenoid - more resonance energy (Ring Fries rule)
