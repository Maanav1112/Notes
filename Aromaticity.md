Aromatic compounds:
- Cyclic
- Planr
- Complete cyclic conjugation
- $4n + 2 \pi$ electrons (Huckel's rule)

Non aromatic compounds:
- Non planar

Anti aromatic:
- Cyclic 
- Planar
- Complete cyclic conjugation
- $4n ]pi$ electrons

Only those pi electrons have to be counted which are participating in complete cyclic resonance
- sp3 - non aromatic (non-planar)
one lp not count as it participates in conjugation (*hybridization*)

- For aromaticity, only the circumferental resonance has to be taken into account
- In many ring structures, A + AA = AA, A + NM = Aromatic
## Annulene
Cyclic conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon is called **annulene**
