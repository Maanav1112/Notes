# Kirchoff's current law
It states that the “total current or charge entering a
junction or node is exactly equal to the charge
leaving the node as it has no other place to go except
to leave, as no charge is lost within the nodes

# Kirchoff's voltage law
● The algebraic sum of all voltages
within the loop must be equal to zero.
● This law is also known as the
conservation of energy.
VAB + VBC + VCD + VDA = 0
