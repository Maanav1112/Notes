# What is a wave ?

A wave is a disturbance in medium that carries energy without net movement of particles. 

Properties: *Elastic and Inertial property*
Elastic is needed in only some waves

Transverse wave: water waves

Transverse : perpendicular
Longitudinal: along

# Wave Terms
Wavelength: distance for crest-crest/compression-compression
Amplitude: maximum displacement from equilibrium
Displacement: displacement from equilibrium
Frequency: rate of disturbance/ number of waves per unit time
Velocity: Velocity of wave/speed of propagation


$$
v = f \lambda
$$

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$
Angular wave number: rad/m
$$
k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}

# Speed of a transverse wave on a spring
$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{length}} \text{of spring}
$$
$$
\lambda = \frac{dm}{dx} \text{or} \frac{m}{l}
$$
[Unit: kg/m]
$$
\lambda = \frac{\rho}{A} 
$$
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}  
$$
where $\mu$ is mass per unit length

$$
v_{solid} = \sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}}
$$
$$
v_{\text{liquid or gases}} = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}
$$
$$
v_{gas} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma p}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}
$$
**Newton's formula**
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}} = \sqrt{ \frac{P}{\rho} }
$$
$$
v = 280 \text{ms}
$$
**Laplace's formula**
$$
v = \sqrt{ \frac{B}{\rho} } = \sqrt{ \frac{\gamma P}{\rho} }
$$
$$
v = 340 ms
$$
Agrees with experimentally calculated value
# Principle of superposition
The resultant displacement of a number of waves in a medium at a particular point is the algebraic sum of the individual displacements produced by each of the waves at that point

# Beats
If two waves can produce interference by overlapping in space, they could also produce interference pattern when they overlap in time; this phenomenon is called beats

T= beat period
$\Delta f$ - beat frequency
$$
\Delta f - \frac{1}{T}
$$
$$
\Delta f = \mid f_{1} - f_{2} | 
$$
