# What is a wave ?

A wave is a disturbance in medium that carries energy without net movement of particles. 

Properties: *Elastic and Inertial property*
Elastic is needed in only some waves

Transverse wave: water waves

Transverse : perpendicular
Longitudinal: along

# Wave Terms
Wavelength: distance for crest-crest/compression-compression
Amplitude: maximum displacement from equilibrium
Displacement: displacement from equilibrium
Frequency: rate of disturbance/ number of waves per unit time
Velocity: Velocity of wave/speed of propagation


$$
v = f \lambda
$$

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$
Angular wave number: rad/m
$$
k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}
$$
# Displacement relation in Progressive Wave
$$
y = f(x.t)
$$
$$
y = f(kx \pm \omega t) \\
= f(\omega t \pm kx)
$$
General wave equation
+ - **positive x axis**
+ + **negative x axis**
$$
v = \frac{\omega}{k}
$$
## Sinusoidal wave
$$
y = A \sin(kx \pm \omega t + \phi)
$$
Initial phase at origin: $\phi$ (phase constant)

*Note:* All these forms are correct
$$
y = A \sin(\omega t \pm kx)
$$
$$
y = A \sin(kx \pm \omega t)
$$
$$
y = A \cos(\omega t \pm kx)
$$
$$
y = A \cos(kx \pm \omega t)
$$
Phase difference between two points in a wave
$$
\Delta \phi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \Delta x
$$
Particle speed: 
$$
v_{p} = \frac{dy}{dt}
$$
**NOTE"** Not a constant

# Speed of a travelling wave

# Speed of a transverse wave on a spring
$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{length}} \text{of spring}
$$
$$
\lambda = \frac{dm}{dx} \text{or} \frac{m}{l}
$$
[Unit: kg/m]
$$
\lambda = \frac{\rho}{A} 
$$
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}  
$$
where $\mu$ is mass per unit length
# Speed of a longitudinal wave (Speed of sound)
![[Pasted image 20240409012043.png]]
$$
v_{solid} = \sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}}
$$
$$
v_{\text{liquid or gases}} = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}
$$
$$
v_{gas} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma p}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}
$$
**Newton's formula**
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}} = \sqrt{ \frac{P}{\rho} }
$$
$$
v = 280 \text{ms}
$$
**Laplace's formula**
$$
v = \sqrt{ \frac{B}{\rho} } = \sqrt{ \frac{\gamma P}{\rho} }
$$
$$
v = 340 ms
$$
Agrees with experimentally calculated value
# Principle of superposition
The resultant displacement of a number of waves in a medium at a particular point is the algebraic sum of the individual displacements produced by each of the waves at that point

# Standing wave and normal modes

Energy is flowing in opposite directions
Energy is contained in a region in standing wave

The wave travelling in the positive direction of the x-axis is given as,
$$
y_{1}(x,t) = a \sin(kx-\omega t)
$$

## Nodes and Antinodes
+ Node: Amplitude is minimum
+ Antinode: Amplitude is maximum
+ fixed end - node/closed
+ free end - antinodes/open pipe

## Harmonics
### End correction
From the internet
	![[Pasted image 20240409021208.png]]
$$
e = 0.3 d
$$
### Both ends are fixed: 
![[Pasted image 20240409021037.png]]
$$
n \frac{\lambda}{2} = l
$$
$$
\frac{n}{2} \frac{v}{f} = l
$$
$$
f = n \frac{v}{2l}
$$
where f-frequency of standing wave
n- mode/harmonic number
f_1 - fundamental frequency

first frequency - fundamental mode
(n-1)th frequency - nth overtone

### Both sides are open:

When the string has one of its ends fixed and the other end is free, the node will be formed at the fixed end, and the antinode will be formed at the free end. The simplest standing wave formed in this condition is one-quarter a wavelength long. The next possible standing wave will be formed by adding both node and antinode. The length of this wave will be three-quarters of the wavelength. In general, the wavelength of the wave can be written as

λ = 4L/n , here n = 1,2,3…..

Then, the frequency of the standing wave is restricted to

f = nv/4L
*Note:*
+ All hormonics are open
+ Only odd hormnoics are present

# Beats
If two waves can produce interference by overlapping in space, they could also produce interference pattern when they overlap in time; this phenomenon is called beats

T= beat period
$\Delta f$ - beat frequency
$$
\Delta f - \frac{1}{T}
$$
$$
\Delta f = \mid f_{1} - f_{2} | 
$$
