[[Cell Cycle and Cell Division]]
[[Meiosis]]
Cytokinesis in animal cell: Here, a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cleavage furrow</mark> is
appeared in the plasma membrane. It gradually deepens
and joins in the centre dividing the cytoplasm into two.

Cytokinesis in plant cell: It is different from the
cytokinesis in animal cells due to the presence of cell wall.
In plant cells, the **vesicles formed from Golgi bodies**
**accumulate at the equator**. It grows outward and meets the
lateral walls. They fuse together to form the cell-plate. It
separates the 2 daughter cells. Later, the c**ell plate becomes**
**the middle lamella.**

During cytokinesis, organelles like mitochondria and
plastids get distributed between the daughter cells.

In some organisms karyokinesis is not followed by
cytokinesi~~s~~. As a result, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">multinucleate condition
(syncytium) arises. E.g. liquid endosperm in coconut.</mark>
