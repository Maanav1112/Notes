Nucleus was first described by *Robert Brown (1831)*.
The material of the nucleus stained by the basic dyes was given the name<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> chromatin</mark> by Flemming.

Normally, a cell has only one nucleus. Some cells have
more than one. Some mature cells lack nucleus. E.g.
mammalian RBC and sieve tube cells of vascular plants.

o Nuclear envelope: Double layered membrane with a
space between (10 - 50 nm) called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">perinuclear spacr</mark>. It
is a barrier between the materials present in nucleus &
cytoplasm. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Outer membrane usually remains continuous
with ER and also bears ribosomes</mark> on it. Nuclear envelope has minute pores formed by the fusion of its two membranes. These are the passages for the
movement of RNA and protein between nucleus and
cytoplasm.
o Nuclear matrix (nucleoplasm)
o Chromatin: A netw*ork of nucleoprotein fibres. It
contains DNA and bas*ic proteins (histones), non-histone
proteins and RNA. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">During cell division, chromatins
condense to form chromosomes</mark>.
o Nucleolus: One or more non-membranous spherical
bodies. It is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">continuous with the nucleoplasm.</mark> It is a site
for ribosomal RNA synthesis.
