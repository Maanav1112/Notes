# What is Photosynthesis ?
Anabolic, enzyme regulated (biochemical) formation of organic materials from CO2, H20 by green parts of the plant (chlorophyll containing) in presence of sunlight, thereby liberating O2, leads to autotrophic nutrition, removes CO2 and generates oxygen, 170 billiono tonees of biomass/year. 70-80 million tons of CO2 is fixed by terrestrial plants.
