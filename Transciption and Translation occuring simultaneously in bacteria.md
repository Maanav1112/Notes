In bacteria, since the **mRNA does not require any processing** to become
active, and also since tr**anscription and translation take place in the same**
**compartment** (there is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria)</mark>,
many times the<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully
transcribed</mark>. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria.
