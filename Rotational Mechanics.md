# Moment of Inertia
Moment of Inertial is resistance to change of state of rotational motion

MOI depends on mass, distribution of mass w.r.t axis, axis of rotation
$$
I = \Sigma m_{i} r_{i}^{2}
$$ *Continuous body*
$$
I =  \int r^2 \, dm 
$$
Clockwise - Anti-clockwise

Definition: imaginary distance from the centroid at which the area of cross-section is imagined to be focused at a point in order to obtain the same moment of inertia

# Equilibrium

N https://unacademy.com/content/upsc/study-material/physics/equilibrium-of-rigid-bodies/
	A rigid body is in mechanical equilibrium when it is neither changing its linear momentum nor its angular momentum at a given point in time. In the absence of linear and angular acceleration, the body is in a state of mechanical equilibrium.Â 
	In such a case, the vector sum of forces on the body is computed as zero, and the vector of the torques is also computed as zero.
	When the total force on a rigid body is zero, then the linear momentum of the rigid body remains unchanged at a given point of time, and the body is said to be in translational equilibrium. When the total torque of the rigid body is zero, then the angular momentum of the rigid body does not change with time, and it is said to be in rotational equilibrium.
	Equilibrium of rigid bodies can be classified as static and dynamic equilibrium.

Rotating rigid body: 
$$
\vec{L} = I. \vec{\omega}
$$
Net torque on a body is the rate of change of angular momentum
$$
\Sigma \vec{\tau} =  \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}
$$
If no net torque acts on a body, then the angular momentum is conserved
